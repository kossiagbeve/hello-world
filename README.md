# hello-world
Hi everyone,
My name is Kossi Ayikouma Agbeve, I am a physicist and data science freelancer. I enjoyed data munging and visualization 
with tools such as Base SAS (Certified), R, and python. I hold a certification in linux administration and I am aspiring 
to change career to data science/statical programmer/Data Analyst.
